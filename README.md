Welcome to the ultimate hangout spot for Web development enthusiasts! We are passionate to develop a website that is a one stop destination for all patient concerns. The
user should be able to find all his/her previous Health Reports , Lab Records ,
previously prescribed medicines, relevant solution or general query related to
their health, find a perfect doctor for their health concerns and an ambulance or
transportation service.


## üëã Why Join Us 
Generally the patients have to save all of their reports especially if
they are dealing with some long ongoing disease which requires
long treatment and usually all of those reports are in paper mode.
Besides the reports, the prescribed medicine are often given on
some chits which often get lost or get misplaced, some of these
reports or medicines are quite important for future prescription of
your medicines or for predicting health conditions. So saving all of
that could prove out quite cumbersome and hectic. The internet
somehow lacked a managed system to keep the digital record of
this doctor patient convo also additionally providing other features
on a health website like basic query solving system about health,
finding specialist doctor , quick ambulance booking service. Join us now and let's shape the future together! üåü

## üéØAIM
The goal of this challenge is to develop a website that
can help the user get easier and faster access to his/her
Health related documents without having to deal with
the hassle of collecting all paper reports. The
documents include all the lab reports, X-ray scans, etc.
The website should also keep a detailed account of all
the medicines the patient was prescribed by various
doctors he/she went to during their previous visits. The
user could also be able to get quick advice through an
inquiry chatbot related to their general day to day health
and to know about the website whereabouts. The main
feature should also include a quick doctor finding
service for your specific health concern like neurologist,
orthologist ,etc . A transportation service should also be
made available to users to book it immediately to the
nearest hospital in case of emergency and for normal
doctor visit.

## ü§îApproach to problem statement

1.Firstly we will be designing a website that would be catering to almost
all of the problems that a patient has to face before reaching the
doctor.

2.The said website allows users to register themselves as patient and
doctor separately. As soon as the user lands on his/her profile they get to
choose from various services which they prefer using for the time being.

3.The user profile includes a detailed description of the patient health
history in the form of various features accessible on the profile

4.The various features available involve access to patient's past reports like
all the scans, doctor's reports, blood reports, etc sorted datewise along
with the consulting doctor . This allows the patient to eliminate the process
of collecting all the paper prescriptions for future use.

5.Other features include implementing a dedicated page
for carrying the record of all the previously prescribed
medicines to the doctor sorted date wise containing
information about the dosage as well as a scanned copy
of the prescription paper

6.Implementing a simple easy to use inquery
system (i.e. a chatbot) which would help
solve every other problem the user faces like
finding your report quickly when logged in,
getting general health advice, how to go to a
certain page of the website etc. 

7.Implementing an ambulance booking service for
the user in case of emergency booking or for a
general doctor's visit. The page would allow
inclusion of google map API to locate and navigate
user's location .

7.Implementing a dedicated page wherein the
patient can quickly search a specialist or
preferred doctor according to their preferences
by reviewing a basic doctor profile and
subsequently connect with the doctor and book
an appointment accordingly.

8.Finally Implementing a user friendly interface of
the entire website so that people with even little
knowledge of internet browsing can easily walk
through the website and enjoy it's services.
